# Getting Started

This guide contains the steps required to install the application on your
computer, get your workout data from your Apple device onto your computer, and
then importing it into the application so you can visualise your workouts.

## Installing Apple Fitness Workout Mapper

To install Apple Fitness Workout Mapper, navigate to the
[releases page in GitHub](https://github.com/martincostello/apple-fitness-workout-mapper/releases/latest).

Find the latest stable release and download the ZIP file for the operating
system of the computer you wish to run Apple Fitness Workout Mapper on.

For example, if you have an Apple Mac computer download the
`AppleFitnessWorkoutMapper-osx-x64.zip` file.

If you have a Windows 10 computer, you would download the
`AppleFitnessWorkoutMapper-win-x64.zip` file.

Once you have downloaded the ZIP file, unzip it to a directory of your choice
on the computer you wish to run the application on.

This will give you a directory that looks something like this:

![Application directory](./images/application-directory.png "Example directory once the ZIP file is extracted on a Windows 10 computer")

Now find the `AppleFitnessWorkoutMapper.exe` file in the directory you extracted
the application to.

> ℹ️ On a Windows computer the file may need to be unblocked before you can run
> the application. To do this, right-click the application and check the **Unblock**
> checkbox and click **Apply** as shown below.

To run Apple Fitness Workout Mapper, double-click the `AppleFitnessWorkoutMapper.exe`
file to start the application. If the application is running successfully, you
should see a window similar to the one below.

![Application running](./images/application-running.png "The AppleFitnessWorkoutMapper.exe file to run the application")

If the application is running successfully you should see no errors or warnings
logged to the terminal and the addresses the application is running on.

To open the application, copy one of the URLs as highlighted below from the
terminal window and visit it in your preferred web browser. The default recommended
URL for you to use is `http://localhost:5000`.

![Application addresses](./images/application-addresses.png "The application's URLs")

If everything is working correctly, you should see something like the below in
your browser.

At this point the application is ready to have the data imported into it.

If you don't see something like the above in your browser check out the
[help guide](https://github.com/martincostello/apple-fitness-workout-mapper/blob/main/docs/help.md#help).
