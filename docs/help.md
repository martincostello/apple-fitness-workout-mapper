## FAQs

### _How do I change from kilometres to miles?_

By default the application uses kilometres to measure distances and kilometres
per hour to measure pace. To change the units to miles and miles per hour, click
the _Kilometres_ option in the top right-hand corner of the navigation bar to
change the units to _Miles_.

![Kilometers/kph](./images/kilometers.png "Kilometers selected")

![Miles/mph](./images/miles.png "Miles selected")

The option you choose will be saved and used next time you use the application
in the same browser and from the same URL.

### _I've imported the data but there are no workouts shown_

By default the application only shows workouts dated within the last 28 days.
Try changing the date range and clicking the "Filter" button to load more
workouts.
